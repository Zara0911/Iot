Steps:- 

1. First to start the practical you need 2 LEDs, 2 resistors, and 3 jumper wires.
2. Now connect two LEDs to the breadboard
3. Next connect the 2 resistors, one end to the negative end of 
the LEDs on the breadboard and the second end to the endpoint of the breadboard. 
4. Connect 2 Jumper Wires to the Positive end of the LEDs. 
5. For the Ground Connection add the third Jumper Wire to the bottom of the breadboard to connect all 
the resistors. 
6. Turn on your mobile phone and install telegram.
7. Create a bot with the help of botfather
 Commands to create a bot : 
a. Go to telegram and search and open botfather 
i. Type the commands: 
ii. /Start
iii. /newbot 

8. Once the bot father is created a bot it will generate a unique id the unique id needs to be added into the code. 

9. Open the bot with the name which you have created 

 Give the start command to turn on the bot. 

 Now you can give commands to blink the led's or to create 
a pattern
