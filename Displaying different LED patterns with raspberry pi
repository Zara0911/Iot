STEPS :-

1) Connect the LED to the breadboard.

2) LED had 2 terminals (One is the longer terminal that is positive, second is the shorter terminal that is negative).

3) Connect one side for the jumper wire below the LED positive side on the breadboard connect the jumper wire below the LED longer terminal.

4) Connect one end of the resistor on the breadboard right below the LED negative side.

5) The other end of the resistor connects it anywhere on the

   breadboard. Now connect another jumper wire right above the second end of the resistor.

6) Connect the positive side of the jumper wire on PIN 7, 29,

   31, 33 and the negative side on PIN 9 of the raspberry pi

i. Longer terminal = Positive (Raspberry Pi Pin7)

ii. Shorter terminal = Negative (Raspberry Pi Pin 9)
